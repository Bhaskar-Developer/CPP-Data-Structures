Stack is a Linear DS which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First in Last Out)

Mainly the following 3 basic operations are performed on the Stack.

Push: Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow Condition. I will use linked list to create Stack. The advantage here is that there is no limitation in  the size of the stack.

Pop: Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.

Peek or Top: Returns the top element of the Stack.

isEmpty: Returns true if stack is empty, else false.
