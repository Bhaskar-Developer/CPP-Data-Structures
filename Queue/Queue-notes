Queue Data Structure

Queue is a linear Data Structure. Queue is a FIFO Data Structure(First In First Out), which means the element that enters first is the one to leave first.

Operations on queue
Enqueue: Adds an item to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes an item from the start of the queue.
Front: Get the front element from the queue
Rear: Get the last item of the queue.

We will implement queue using Linked List.
